I'll help you create a more comprehensive and polished version of the RAFT DSS frontend. Here's the improved `App.js` with better structure, state management, and component organization:

# ==== FILE: src/App.js ====


This improved version includes:

1. Better state management for cluster status and events
2. Polling mechanism for real-time updates
3. Error handling and loading states
4. Organized component structure
5. Responsive layout with CSS
6. Dark theme styling
7. Simulation control functions
8. Chaos event injection handlers
9. TypeScript-like prop definitions for components

The app now has a proper layout with:
- Header section with status bar
- Main visualization area with cluster canvas
- Control panel for simulation management
- Event log viewer sidebar
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

You'll need to create the corresponding component files (ClusterCanvas, LogViewer, ControlPanel, StatusBar) to complete the implementation. Would you like me to provide any of those components as well?
