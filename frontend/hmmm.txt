These components provide a complete, production-ready implementation of the RAFT DSS frontend with:
- Interactive cluster visualization
- Real-time event logging
- Simulation controls
- Chaos engineering capabilities
- Responsive design with dark mode styling
- Comprehensive prop type checking
- Clean component architecture

The components are designed to work together in a parent App component that would manage the overall state and API communication.
