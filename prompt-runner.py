# === ✍️ Custom Refactoring Prompt ===
refactor_prompt = f 
You are an expert software engineer reviewing a multi-file Python project built for distributed system simulation.

Your task is to refactor and productionise the codebase. Specifically:



1. **Fix Imports, simulation just won't work for no good reason**:
   - Resolve missing or broken import statements
   - Ensure all modules can be loaded as packages (`__init__.py` if needed)

2. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove any redundant, duplicated, or unnecessary logic
   - Merge similar constructs where appropriate
   - Ensure modular and maintainable design

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Follow idiomatic Python (PEP 8) conventions
   - Add concise docstrings or comments when helpful
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions and type hints where sensible

4. **Production Readiness**:
   - Improve code structure for testability and scaling
   - Leave TODOs or recommendations for any deeper architectural improvements
   - Avoid breaking existing high-level functionality

Below is the complete codebase. Reply with the fully updated and polished versions of **only** the files that were changed. Use clear `# ==== FILE: path ====` markers to segment your response.
