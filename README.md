#RAFT DSS — A Production-Grade Distributed Systems Engine

**Problem**
 - Understanding distributed consensus algorithms like RAFT requires hands-on experimentation with leader election, log replication, and network partition scenarios—but most educational resources offer only theoretical explanations.
Real-world distributed systems engineers need practical experience with fault-tolerance, message-passing semantics, and consensus behaviour under realistic network conditions.

**Solution**

This RAFT simulator provides a comprehensive, event-driven environment for exploring distributed consensus from the ground up:

 - Pure Python Implementation: RAFT consensus algorithm built from scratch with full state machine semantics
 - Realistic Network Simulation: configurable latency, packet loss, and partition injection
 - High-Performance Event Engine: processes thousands of consensus events per second with microsecond precision
 - Production-Grade Architecture: modular design supporting algorithm swapping and extensibility

**Core Features**

 - Complete RAFT Implementation: leader election, log replication, term management, and follower synchronisation
 - Network Fault Injection: message drops, delays, duplicates, and network partitions with statistical modelling
 - Event-Driven Simulation: priority-queue scheduling with deterministic replay and comprehensive logging
 - Configurable Cluster Topologies: support for 3–100+ node clusters with dynamic failure scenarios
Rich Observability: detailed state tracking, message tracing, and consensus timeline reconstruction
Chaos Engineering: automated failure injection patterns including rolling failures and split-brain scenarios

**System Architecture**

**The simulator follows a clean event-driven pipeline:**

 - Simulation Engine (simulation/) — priority-queue event scheduler with microsecond timing
 - Node Implementation (nodes/) — RAFT state machines with leader election and log replication
 - Message Layer (messaging/) — realistic network simulation with configurable failure modes
 - Failure Injection (failure/) — chaos engineering toolkit for testing fault-tolerance
 - Configuration (config.py) — centralised tuning for network conditions and cluster behaviour

**Each layer operates independently, enabling modular testing and algorithm experimentation.**
