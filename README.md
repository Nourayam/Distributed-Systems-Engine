# RAFT DSS â€” A Production-Grade Distributed Systems Engine

## Problem
Understanding distributed consensus algorithms like RAFT needs hands-on experimentation with leader election, log replication, and network partition scenarios, but most educational resources only offer theoretical explanations.  
Real-world distributed systems engineers need practical experience with fault-tolerance, message-passing semantics, and consensus behaviour under realistic network conditions. Understanding is key, if we can understand exactly how DSs work, we'll be able to maintain them better too.

## Solution
This RAFT simulator provides a comprehensive, event-driven environment for exploring distributed consensus from square 1:

- **Pure Python Implementation:** RAFT consensus algorithm built from scratch with full state machine semantics  
- **Realistic Network Simulation:** configurable latency, packet loss, and partition injection  
- **High-Performance Event Engine:** processes thousands of consensus events per second with microsecond precision  
- **Production-Grade Architecture:** modular design supporting algorithm swapping and extensibility

## Core Features

- **Complete RAFT Implementation:** leader election, log replication, term management, and follower synchronisation  
- **Network Fault Injection:** message drops, delays, duplicates, and network partitions with statistical modelling  
- **Event-Driven Simulation:** priority-queue scheduling with deterministic replay and comprehensive logging  
- **Configurable Cluster Topologies:** support for 3â€“100+ node clusters with dynamic failure scenarios  
- **Rich Observability:** detailed state tracking, message tracing, and consensus timeline reconstruction  
- **Chaos Engineering:** automated failure injection patterns including rolling failures and split-brain scenarios

## System Architecture

The simulator follows a clean event-driven pipeline:

- `simulation/` â€” priority-queue event scheduler with microsecond timing  
- `nodes/` â€” RAFT state machines with leader election and log replication  
- `messaging/` â€” realistic network simulation with configurable failure modes  
- `failure/` â€” chaos engineering toolkit for testing fault-tolerance  
- `config.py` â€” centralised tuning for network conditions and cluster behaviour  

Each layer operates independently which enables modular testing and algorithm experimentation.

Running the RAFT Distributed Systems Simulator - Complete Setup Guide
Prerequisites
Before running the simulator, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Node.js 14 or higher (includes npm)
Git (for cloning the repository)

Backend Setup and Running Instructions

Step 1: Navigate to the Backend Directory
bashCopycd DSS/backend

Step 2: Create a Python Virtual Environment
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts:
On Windows:
bashCopy# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bashCopy# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt when the virtual environment is activated.

Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
First, create a requirements.txt file in the backend directory with the following content:
txtCopyFlask==2.3.2
flask-cors==4.0.0
werkzeug==2.3.6
Then install the dependencies:
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Create Missing Backend Files

Step 5: Create a .env File (Optional)
Create a .env file in the backend directory for any environment-specific settings:
bashCopyFLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
PORT=5000
Step 6: Run the Backend Server
With all files in place and dependencies installed, run the Flask server:
bashCopypython app.py
You should see output like:
CopyðŸš€ Starting RAFT Distributed Systems Simulator Backend...
ðŸ“¡ API available at: http://localhost:5000
ðŸ”— Frontend should connect to: http://localhost:5000
ðŸ“š API Documentation: http://localhost:5000/docs
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://[your-ip]:5000

Step 7: Verify the Backend is Running
Open a new terminal and test the API:
bashCopy# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check RAFT status
curl http://localhost:5000/raft/status
You should get JSON responses confirming the backend is working.
Frontend Setup and Running Instructions

Step 1: Open a New Terminal
Keep the backend running and open a new terminal window.

Step 2: Navigate to Frontend Directory
bashCopycd DSS/frontend

Step 3: Install Node Dependencies
bashCopynpm install
This will install all packages listed in package.json. If you encounter any issues:
bashCopy# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install

Step 4: Verify Environment Configuration
Ensure the .env file in the frontend directory contains:
CopyREACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

Step 5: Start the Frontend Development Server
bashCopynpm start
The React development server will start and automatically open your browser to http://localhost:3000.
You should see:
CopyCompiled successfully!

You can now view raft-frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://[your-ip]:3000
Troubleshooting Guide
Backend Issues

1. ModuleNotFoundError:
bashCopy# Ensure you're in the backend directory and venv is activated
cd DSS/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Port 5000 Already in Use:
bashCopy# Find process using port 5000
# On Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# On macOS/Linux:
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process or use a different port:
python app.py --port 5001
3. CORS Issues:
bashCopy# Ensure flask-cors is installed
pip install flask-cors
Frontend Issues
1. npm start fails:
bashCopy# Check Node version
node --version  # Should be 14+

# Clear everything and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
2. Cannot connect to backend:

Ensure backend is running on port 5000
Check .env file has correct API URL
Check browser console for errors
Disable any ad blockers or browser extensions

3. Blank page or React errors:
bashCopy# Check for missing dependencies
npm install axios react-tooltip

# If using Windows, try:
npm install --force
Running in Production Mode
Backend Production Setup:
bashCopy# Install production server
pip install gunicorn

# Run with gunicorn (Linux/macOS)
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

# Or use waitress on Windows
pip install waitress
python -c "from waitress import serve; from app import app; serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)"
Frontend Production Build:
bashCopy# Create optimised production build
npm run build

# Serve the build (install serve globally first)
npm install -g serve
serve -s build -l 3000
Complete Startup Script
Create a start-simulator.sh (macOS/Linux) or start-simulator.bat (Windows) file:
macOS/Linux (start-simulator.sh):
bashCopy#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting RAFT Distributed Systems Simulator..."

# Start backend
echo "Starting backend..."
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py &
BACKEND_PID=$!

# Wait for backend to start
sleep 3

# Start frontend
echo "Starting frontend..."
cd ../frontend
npm start &
FRONTEND_PID=$!

echo "Simulator running!"
echo "Backend PID: $BACKEND_PID"
echo "Frontend PID: $FRONTEND_PID"
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop both services"

# Wait for interrupt
wait
Windows (start-simulator.bat):
batchCopy@echo off
echo Starting RAFT Distributed Systems Simulator...

echo Starting backend...
cd backend
start cmd /k "venv\Scripts\activate && python app.py"

timeout /t 3

echo Starting frontend...
cd ..\frontend
start cmd /k "npm start"

echo Simulator running!
echo Close the command windows to stop the services
pause
Make the script executable:
bashCopy# macOS/Linux
chmod +x start-simulator.sh
./start-simulator.sh

# Windows
start-simulator.bat
API Testing with Postman
Import these requests into Postman for testing:

Health Check: GET http://localhost:5000/health
Get Status: GET http://localhost:5000/raft/status
Start Simulation: POST http://localhost:5000/raft/start
jsonCopy{
  "nodeCount": 5,
  "maxTime": 60,
  "messageDropRate": 0.1
}

Stop Simulation: POST http://localhost:5000/raft/stop
Inject Chaos: POST http://localhost:5000/raft/chaos
jsonCopy{
  "type": "KILL_NODE",
  "nodeId": 2
}


Now you should have a fully functional RAFT Distributed Systems Simulator running! The backend will handle the simulation logic whilst the frontend provides a beautiful visualisation of the consensus algorithm in action.
